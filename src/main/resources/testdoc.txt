CARING FOR THE EARTH
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Events converged during 1988 to make the state of the Earth a matter of keen
public concern. Now comes the difficult part. In 1989 the involved officials
must move forcefully to translate that concern into serious public policy so
that this new awareness does not become just another passing trend or lost
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
The issues will not go away. There is a danger, however, that the enormousness
of the collective problem will overwhelm a public desire to do something. After
all, what can one person do about the atmosphere or the ocean? The United
States has become a result-oriented nation that likes to see some bang for its
buck, and soon. A dollar invested today to avert a global-warming crisis may
have no visible payoff for decades.
</P>
<P>
But perception is critically important. What made 1988 the year of the Earth
may have been a coincidence of unrelated and largely irrelevant circumstances.
The appearance of medical waste on Atlantic beaches or the Yellowstone Park
fires had nothing to do with the ozone hole. The 1988 drought may have had
nothing to do with global warming. The growing trash crisis certainly did not.
But all these events impinged on the public consciousness until they set off an
alarm bell: Something is very wrong.
</P>
<P>
The importance of this public attention cannot be underrated. But little
happened in 1988 that was new or surprising to most environmental scientists.
And Earthlings possess most or all of the technical equipment needed to slow or
halt just about all the bad things that are assaulting the planet. What has
been lacking is the public demand, the political will and an institutional
structure for facing the challenge.
</P>
<P>
The new year provides the opportunity for setting this process in motion. The
obvious source of leadership is the presidency. President-elect George Bush
already has been inundated with stacks of studies for combatting environmental
problems on a national and global scale. One of the best was compiled by a
50-member bipartisan task force under the chairmanship of Sens. Timothy E.
Wirth (D-Colo.) and John Heinz III (R-Pa.). In addition to the more traditional
regulatory controls, the plan emphasizes the search for common ground and the
development of market incentives for pollution control.
</P>
<P>
The Wirth-Heinz outline also makes the critical point that the public must be
informed of the full social costs of environmental action or inaction, not just
the direct outlays. Because so many environmental issues are interrelated, some
policies will attack several problems at once and provide multiple benefits.
The energy-efficiency program advocated by the Wirth-Heinz study would help
fight global warming, acid rain and local air pollution while also improving
U.S. energy security and productivity. Short-term investments can yield
long-range national economic benefits. Existing fragmented federal policies
often work at cross-purposes or lack the public attention and support that they
deserve.
</P>
<P>
Bush will have to decide what he thinks are the most effective means of
advancing the environmental agenda. An address to Congress is an obvious
possibility. Or he could revive the dormant President's Council on
Environmental Quality, which is supposed to serve as a clearing house and as a
coordinator of programs. Better yet would be the creation of a Cabinet
Department of the Environment that would consolidate the Environmental
Protection Agency with related agencies from within the Interior and
Agriculture departments. Most other industrialized nations created
cabinet-level environmental agencies years ago.
</P>
<P>
Since so many of these issues observe no boundaries, the United States must
pursue international agreements to control pollutants and preserve critical
rain forests. The environment is an appropriate topic for the next superpower
summit and the annual meeting of the Western industrial nations, leading
perhaps to a global environmental conference.
</P>
<P>
Environmental problems, from protection of U.S. wild lands to the global
atmosphere, seem immense. Still, every citizen can have an effect. It begins
with caring.

JUDGE'S RULING IN BABY KILLING
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When I was a medical student in Sacramento in the 1970s, I was a member of a
multidisciplinary team of professionals who worked hundreds of hours a year
attempting to help children who were battered, tortured, and mutilated by
people who unfortunately had the biological capability of bearing them.
</P>
<P>
One particularly disgusting example was a female who had killed one of her
children, severely tortured two others, and finally managed to kill a third,
who had been sent back into the home by a "compassionate" judge who felt that
the biological mother was more valuable than a foster one. This woman was
admitted to our hospital in Sacramento to bear another child.
</P>
<P>
Our child abuse team reacted quickly, obtaining a court order to take the
newborn child away. The woman sued, but quickly dropped the case, deciding to
move to Nevada and "have all the babies I want." I felt a profound sense of
nausea, sadness, and anger for weeks following that horrible case. The outcome
caused one of our social workers to resign -- she just couldn't handle these
situations anymore.
</P>
<P>
I felt the same sense of nausea, sadness, and anger when I read the article
regarding Judge Robert R. Fitzgerald's ruling in the case of Sheryl Lynn
Massip's battering and eventual murder of her infant son ("Judge Clears Mother
Who Killed Baby," Part I, Dec. 24).
</P>
<P>
From my previous reading about the case, there would appear little doubt that
the woman battered and killed her son. A jury of her peers came to this
conclusion after a long, and I am sure, emotionally difficult trial. There is
little doubt in my mind also that the woman was emotionally distraught when she
murdered her baby.
</P>
<P>
But criminally insane? A much more profound proposition! When I worked as a
family physician, I delivered hundreds of babies, and followed these kids and
their mothers through the early years of their lives. No murders. A few
distraught mothers who needed to talk out their frustrations, but no murders.
What happened with Sheryl Lynn Massip?
</P>
<P>
If Massip was criminally insane, why were the examining psychiatrists and her
jurors unable to realize this? In explaining his reasoning, Judge Fitzgerald
said, " . . . I didn't have any choice but to find her insane. . . . She was
bonkers." Well, judge, I think you had two other fairly obvious choices: First,
you could do your job as described by law; you could administer an appropriate
sentence based upon the verdict handed down by the jury. A murder conviction
demands a murder sentence.
</P>
<P>
Second, if you truly bought the concept that the defendant was insane on the
basis of postpartum depression, and was therefore totally out of control, you
could have acted to save the lives of her future babies by ordering that the
woman undergo sterilization. If she was truly insane as a result of her
postpartum hormonal imbalance, why should she be any less insane with her next
baby?

JUDGE'S RULING IN BABY KILLING
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Since it seems quite likely that the Supreme Court will overturn or
significantly modify Roe vs. Wade, Judge Fitzgerald's decision to reject the
jury's guilty verdict in the Massip case is most timely.
</P>
<P>
Abortions will no longer be necessary, anyway, now that the mother can run over
the kid and plead "postpartum psychosis" (or "bonkers" to put it in the judge's
more technical language).

THE CAMPUS AND PUBLIC SERVICE
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Increasing numbers of college students want to serve their communities. Some
help homeless people find shelter and services. Others tutor children or teach
the illiterate how to read. Now a coalition of more than 40 California colleges
and universities, public and private, has agreed to help these students to help
others. The California Compact, as it is called, plans to work with communities
to identify the problems on which students could work, try to win foundation
support for these volunteer programs, and get faculty members as well as
students involved. It's a gift of commitment that should not go unnoticed.
</P>
<P>
The California Compact has just been launched as part of a national effort
called Campus Compact, which is sponsored by the Education Commission of the
States and has been in existence for several years. The California group is
co-chaired by Stanford University President Don Kennedy and UCLA Chancellor
Charles E. Young, and includes among others the University of Southern
California, Occidental College, Claremont McKenna College, Los Angeles City
College, the California State University system and the University of
California campuses. The James Irvine Foundation has just announced a $120,000
donation over the next three years to enable private universities to
participate in the compact.
</P>
<P>
It's just this kind of program that California legislators sought to foster
when they passed a bill sponsored by Assemblyman John Vasconcellos (D-Santa
Clara). That measure encouraged students to work 30 hours a year in their
communities and urged their colleges to help them, in part by providing
academic credit for some of their work. The efforts have gotten under way
despite the governor's unwillingness to spend the $240,000 needed to help
organize the program.
</P>
<P>
In announcing the organization of the compact, UCLA's Chancellor Young said
recently that government resources may continue to be scarce, "but our human
resources are potentially unlimited." He said that the colleges want to help
build a "citizenry of problem solvers."
</P>
<P>
People who have studied college life have said for years that higher education
could be made more meaningful if it inculcated in young Americans the value of
public service. The California Compact aims to make that recommendation a
reality.
