JAZZ DICTIONARY FOR THE EVERYMAN DEBUTS
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By OWEN McNALLY, The Hartford Courant
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Weighing in at almost 10 pounds, "The New Grove Dictionary of Jazz" is the
undisputed, world heavyweight champion of jazz scholarship, a highly readable,
scrupulously researched two-volume, 1,400-page compendium packed with
everything you always wanted to know about jazz but were afraid to ask.
</P>
<P>
About as hefty is the price: $295.
</P>
<P>
"We haven't aimed the dictionary just at the jazz insider. And we don't presume
that everybody knows what a 'honk' (a loud blaring note on the saxophone) is or
what a gig (job) is, or even what a clarinet is. We've aimed at a very general
audience interested in the music," chief editor and musicologist Barry Kernfeld
said recently in a telephone interview from Oxford, England.
</P>
<P>
Kernfeld initiated the mammoth project and has devoted the last 4 1/2 years to
editing and organizing the work, which has been written by more than 250
contributors from around the world.
</P>
<P>
"It has been a labor of love and absolutely all I've done for 4 1/2 years. I'm
a saxophonist, but I haven't played a note all that time," said Kernfeld, who
has been on the road promoting the magnum opus. The jazz scholar has been
plugging the classy product in New York, San Francisco, Paris, London and even
in a 5-minute appearance on NBC's "Today Show."
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to open up the literature for everyone. And we wanted it to be
wide-ranging, with a lot more than just biographical entries," Kernfeld said.
</P>
<P>
"We especially wanted it to be even-handed in its treatment of all styles
because so many people get bogged down in factionalism in jazz. Some people
hate bop, and some hate everything but bop, and we've tried to avoid that kind
of divisiveness."
</P>
<P>
The Grove music dictionaries are to music what the Oxford English Dictionary is
to language -- a scholarly source revered by many as the ultimate authority on
matters of fact.
</P>
<P>
Lavishly illustrated with 220 rare photographs from the celebrated Frank Driggs
Collection, the handsomely bound volumes -- a bibliophile's delight -- surpass
all earlier jazz dictionaries and encyclopedias in breadth and depth with its
4,500 entries, 3,000 biographies, 1,800 discographies and more than 1,000
cross-references.
</P>
<P>
Besides its exhaustive Who's Who of jazz from Louis Armstrong to Joe Zawinul,
the dictionary offers well-written entries on a dazzling variety of topics.
</P>
<P>
Among these are musical styles ranging from ragtime to free jazz, jazz
instruments from kazoo to synthesizer, record labels both flourishing and
defunct, fabled jazz nightclubs around the world and festivals.
</P>
<P>
There are more than 100 magazine-length entries on specialized areas, including
improvisation (the heart of the matter for jazz), arrangement, harmony, form
and notation. All are illustrated with copious musical illustrations.
</P>
<P>
"A small part of the dictionary is esoteric, but we also wanted to reach the
serious fan who might want more in-depth knowledge of specialized subjects like
harmony, or about specific things like how chordal substitution works in the
bop style," Kernfeld said.
</P>
<P>
If these more technical areas sound too dry, rest assured that there are plenty
of juicy areas to tromp around in, including a fascinating 11-page essay on the
role jazz has played in films.
</P>
<P>
Besides being an invaluable resource book, the dictionary is fun to thumb
through.
</P>
<P>
Ardent fans will have a good time second-guessing the scholars and finding
fault with their judgment about who gets in and who is excluded from this work,
which is now the official jazz pantheon.
</P>
<P>
"You have to take a critical stand here, but that's what Grove is all about,"
Kernfeld said when asked about the dictionary's process of natural selection.
</P>
<P>
"A quarter of the book is devoted to non-American subjects, so I've had New
Yorkers asking me why there are so many Europeans. The English are asking why
aren't there more English, and the French are asking why there aren't more
French."
</P>
<P>
Errors, of course, are the ultimate nightmare for editors of any dictionary or
encyclopedia, and jazz, as liberated as it is, provides no exception.
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most consistently misspelled name in jazz history has been
Thelonious Monk's unusual first name.
</P>
<P>
Grove has it right.

Former Channel 39 sports guy Al Janis asked what may have been the unwisest
question of 1988. Frustrated with all the changes at the station, Janis went to
his boss and demanded to know whether he was going to be kept around after the
transition period.
</P>
<P>
"Well, Al, now that you mention it . . . " was the reply, and Al went back to
clean out his desk.
</P>
<P>
The moral: Don't ask a question if you don't want to hear the answer.
</P>
<P>
This is a strong argument for ignoring the urge to speculate about the year
ahead. Perhaps we're better off taking the experiential approach, blissfully
letting events sweep over us.
</P>
<P>
But that would be no fun. As a great philosopher once said, speculation is the
spice of life (or something like that).
</P>
<P>
Certainly it is fair to speculate that KFMB-TV (Channel 8) viewers will be
seeing more of anchorwoman Andrea Naversen in the next year. She has that
professional, easy-to-look-at, Ice Queen-look, popularized locally by Bree
Walker. The Ice Queen-look is apparently "in," so there is no doubt Naversen
will be working her way up the Channel 8 ladder of success, especially since
current No. 1 anchor Allison Ross' relationship with the station is rumored to
resemble that of the Bundy family on "Married . . . With Children."
</P>
<P>
Over at Channel 39, viewers certainly will be seeing a lot more of former
newspaperman Bill Ritter, who is becoming the station's designated hitter, the
epitome of Channel 39's attempt to build a hard-news image. Now that Ritter has
mastered the intricacies of television news -- his hair and makeup look great
-- he is on the Channel 39 fast track.
</P>
<P>
Also watch for more of Dave Bender at Channel 39. Bender reeks of perkiness. He
is perky enough to be a poster child for a campaign to ban caffeine. Bender's
perky weather reports and perky puff features are already starting to get more
play, especially since semi-perky weatherman Brian Hackney recently said a
short goodby.
</P>
<P>
And speaking of people born to smile 'til it hurts, 1989 will be a big year for
Bill Griffith and the folks at Channel 10's "InSide San Diego." When Channel 10
started the show, station officials said they were going to give it at least a
year to build an audience. The year is up in June, and, following standard
television operating practice, Channel 10 probably will either can the
chat-fest, fire the hosts or make it a semi-permanent part of the station's
schedule.
</P>
<P>
The year ahead also will be crucial to Larry Himmel, who probably will get a
chance to take his new Channel 39 show weekly, and for XTRA-AM (690), which is
trying to establish its news-talk format amid a general "who cares" sentiment
among radio listeners.
</P>
<P>
Also in the "who cares" department, KSWV-FM (102.9) will continue its attempt
to convince people that modern elevator music is "The Wave" of the future.
After an initial ratings flourish, listeners throughout the country have been
opting to pass on "The Wave." The hiring of disc jockey Art Good, local radio's
answer to Sleep-eze, is unlikely to revive the local version.
</P>
<P>
Of course, all this is simply speculation, similar to these predictions for the
New Year:
</P>
<P>
* Channel 8 weatherman Larry Mendte will be asked to host "The Gong Show," but
he'll turn it down to take a job in the Bush Administration.
</P>
<P>
* Channel 10 will rename its 5 p.m. broadcast "ZooNews," and reporter Margaret
Radford will win an Emmy for a poignant and moving feature entitled "Your
Friend the Giraffe."
</P>
<P>
* Frustrated by lack of interest in his new television show, former mayor Roger
Hedgecock will form a traveling nude mud-wrestling troupe, featuring himself as
the ringmaster.
</P>
<P>
* Channel 10's Kimberly Hunt, impressed with the hair dye-jobs of fellow
broadcasters Jerry G. Bishop and Mitch Duncan -- and tired of being called a
blonde bimbo by local radio personalities -- will decide to dye her hair
purple. She also will legally change her name to "Babycakes."
</P>
<P>
* Channel 39 sports guy Bobby Estill will quit to become the new sports
columnist for GQ magazine. He'll be fired when he refuses to wear socks.
</P>
<P>
Remember, you heard it here first.
</P>
<P>
Friday was the last day of local radio traffic reports from the Automobile Club
of Southern California, the second traffic report service to fold since the
national Metro Traffic service moved into San Diego a few months ago. "The
service was no longer unique, so we decided to place the resources elsewhere,"
Auto Club assistant district director Bill Schurmer said. Metro will pick up
several of the Auto Club's contracts, but local traffic reporter Jon Hoffman
has landed the gig with KKLQ-FM (Q106) and KNSD-TV (Channel 39). . . . KSDO-AM
(1130) afternoon talk-show host Stacy Taylor has been one of Kimberly Hunt's
main tormentors. Friday afternoon, Hunt will be a guest on his show. Meanwhile,
Michael Tuck will be a guest on Gloria Penner's KPBS-TV (Channel 15) talk show,
6:30 p.m., Sunday. It will mark the start of Penner's fifth year. . . .
</P>
<P>
It must be nice to be editor of your own paper. Not only did the Tribune do a
massive puff piece on editor Neil Morgan a couple of weeks ago, but last week
Morgan managed to get a Page 1 photo credit for a photo of his own mountain
cabin. And, in Friday's column, he sneaked in a plug for his wife's cover story
in the January issue of Travel &amp; Leisure.

MUSICAL AND X-RATED SIDES OF A BLUE COIN
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
B.B. King posed the question of the night Saturday when he sang one of his
signature songs: "How Blue Can You Get?"
</P>
<P>
In the first of two New Year's Eve shows at the Celebrity Theatre in Anaheim,
King and Bobby "Blue" Bland both provided the traditional response in solid,
sometimes eloquent sets, well stocked with classics of the genre. For them, how
blue you can get depends on how much emotion you can generate in a song -- and
the answer for both was plenty.
</P>
<P>
For Millie Jackson, being blue has more to do with the profanely outrageous
comic tradition of Redd Foxx and Richard Pryor than with the musical tradition
of the other two stars on this triple bill.
</P>
<P>
How blue can you get? Well, by the end of her 55 minutes on stage, there was no
question about which Jackson is really Bad. Like Michael, who is no relation,
Millie made a point of grabbing at her crotch during an X-rated, bump-and-grind
version of "Something You Can Feel." Actually, she took it a step further,
getting comic mileage by grabbing at male targets in the audience.
</P>
<P>
Jackson wound up overdoing the saucy and scatological stuff. It would have been
better to hear more of her gritty funk singing and ardor-filled soul balladry
-- and less of her salty rapping about male shortcomings and female survival
tactics. She might have hit a workable balance if she had played it straight
with her last number, "Love Is a Dangerous Game," rather than turning it into
yet another rude spoken rap.
</P>
<P>
In these Sam Kinison days, dirty talk is cheap indeed, while singing voices
like Jackson's are rare. She may have been breaking ground in the '70s with her
raw comedy, but there is a greater need now for more moments such as her
exciting improvisation at the end of "An Imitation of Love."
</P>
<P>
If brashness is Jackson's hallmark, Bland's is restraint. It served him well in
a 40-minute performance in which his singing was often stirring enough to
elicit testifying cries from the audience.
</P>
<P>
That old-fashioned response was probably prompted by some old-fashioned musical
virtues. Bland had a crack, eight-piece backing band that moved deftly through
rich, varied song arrangements. With full-bodied musical output such as that --
featuring real horns and a real Hammond organ -- one has to wonder why so many
contemporary R&amp;B singers settle for emaciated and phony-sounding production
founded upon tinkling synthesizers and sound-alike computer rhythms.
</P>
<P>
Using understatement rather than big vocal gestures, Bland's singing
consistently brought emotions into clear focus. Whether pleading for romance on
the soul-flavored ballad "Share Your Love With Me," or suffering existential
slings and arrows on "Stormy Monday," Bland sang with conviction and immediacy,
and his refusal to grandstand added another fine quality: intimacy.
</P>
<P>
B.B. King made it a happy new year for anyone who loves to hear him play the
guitar. In his previous county appearance, in August at Michael's Supper Club,
King was content to be an entertainer, a talkative, gracious host rather than a
musical dynamo. This time he came to make music.
</P>
<P>
The 90-minute set was crammed with liberal guitar solos in King's distinctive,
clean-but-rough-edged style. Highlights included "You Know I Love You,"
rendered as a lovely, lyrical guitar ballad, and "Why I Sing the Blues," which
found King skittering up and down the fret board in a playfully rocking
performance.
</P>
<P>
King's singing was forceful, although he no longer has the impressive high
range that he did 15 or 20 years ago. Perhaps he was limited by the sore throat
that he said was bothering him.
</P>
<P>
King stuck to older material rather than play anything from his new album,
"King of the Blues: 1989," and that was just as well. In a crowd-pleasing
ending, he sang "The Thrill Is Gone," the 1970 hit that brought him to the
attention of the rock generation, then swung into a funky reading of "When Love
Comes to Town," the new number from U2's "Rattle &amp; Hum" album that features
King in a vibrant guest shot.

SHOW SCHEDULE HOLDS HOPE OF A HAPPY NEW YEAR

<P>
A fireboat captain I know (whose firehouse must be the only one that regularly
posts art reviews) always kids me about my writing. "Why don't you ever say
something positive?" he jokes. "Just say something nice once in awhile!"
</P>
<P>
Believe it or not, I yearn to do exactly that. But much of the art shown in
Orange County (and just about everywhere else; relax, ye civic boosters!) is
mediocre. Too many exhibitions are ineptly conceived and lacking in
intellectual substance, and the art too often tends to be timid, boring and
parochial.
</P>
<P>
These days, when we do get worthy art to look at, it is frequently packaged as
an homage to a collector's good taste. Collectors have an important place in
the art world, for obvious reasons. Art patrons have played a major role in the
history of art.
</P>
<P>
But art institutions have become too beholden to the consumer mentality of the
'80s. We need to be looking at significant works of art not as fine possessions
purchased by x but as significant entities in their own right. The best and
most memorable exhibits tend to be organized around a strong intellectual
concept: a curator's notion of how a particular artist developed his or her
style or how a body of art relates to the preoccupations of the society in
which it was created.
</P>
<P>
In a larger sense, museums and other art institutions are doing their job when
they give viewers "what's good for them" rather than what they seem to want.
Art is a specialized field -- as specialized as computer technology or
arbitrage or microbiology. Rather than second-guess the interests of "average
viewers," art institutions are in a position to introduce them to art they
don't already know and love -- provided that the institutions' overseeing
boards of directors or city departments don't stubbornly stand in their way.
</P>
<P>
By the same token, clarity and depth are the watchwords of first-class
exhibition materials. Contemporary art is often based on difficult and unusual
ideas. Older art is best understood in its historical context. Too often
viewers of contemporary art are expected to wade through confusing texts
bristling with unfamiliar terminology, and viewers of historical material are
sent on their way with wishy-washy platitudes.
</P>
<P>
Encouragingly, however, this year's exhibition schedule includes a quartet of
particularly meaty approaches to art.
</P>
<P>
At Newport Harbor Art Museum, "L.A. Pop in the Sixties" (April 23 to July 9)
will reconsider Pop Art in Los Angeles -- as exemplified by the work of Ed
Ruscha, Joe Goode, Billy Al Bengston, Wallace Berman, Vija Celmins, John
Baldessari and others -- in light of the movement's conceptual underpinnings.
To quote the museum's press materials, the exhibit will deal with "the
relationship between visual 'sign' and written word, the conceptual
manipulation of common objects and an extreme autobiographical bias" on the
part of the artists.
</P>
<P>
"American Landscape Video: The Electronic Grove," coming in the fall to Newport
Harbor (organized by Carnegie Institute Museum of Art at Carnegie Mellon
University in Pittsburg) will survey 20 years of video installations by Dara
Birnbaum, Frank Gillette, Doug Hall, Mary Lucier, Bill Viola and others (Oct.
20 to Dec. 31). Besides experiencing the sheer visual impact of works by major
American video artists, viewers may look for curatorial insights into the way
an age-old theme in art -- landscape -- has been transformed into a
psychologically acute and technologically complex form.
</P>
<P>
At the Laguna Art Museum, "David Park" (March 9 to May 17) will present 75
works from the 1950s by the San Francisco Bay Area painter who abandoned
abstraction to strike out on his own as a forceful realist. Organized by
curator Richard Armstrong at the Whitney Museum of American Art, the show has
been criticized because it analyzes Park's achievement in purely formalist
terms even though the artist was deeply and chiefly interested in portraying
lonely people in everyday settings. It will be interesting to see how the work
holds up under such heavy-duty, if seemingly misguided, scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
UC Irvine's Fine Arts Gallery will offer a peek at the collecting habits of no
less than Sigmund Freud, who fancied Egyptian bronzes, Greek and Roman terra
cottas and various pieces of Asian art (Nov. 12 to Dec. 10). Unlike the usual
run of "collector" shows, the collector is rightly paramount in this exhibit.
What did art mean to the founder of psychoanalysis and why did he choose to
live with particular works? That's what we will want to read about in the
catalogue for the show, curated by Lynn Gamwell for the State University of New
York at Binghamton.
</P>
<P>
Coincidentally, the exhibition roster also includes three exhibits consisting
primarily of drawings by artists known for ambitious, large-scale projects.
Granted, such shows tend to be on the dry side visually, but if presented well
they can impart valuable information about the way artistic ideas develop and
mature.
</P>
<P>
"Barry Le Va: 1968-1988," at Newport Harbor, will present 80 drawings (and,
happily, six re-created installations) by the California artist (Jan. 20 to
April 2). Le Va is famed for his "scatter pieces," made with eccentric
materials that included flour, felt, bullets and paper towels strewn around
defined spaces according to a particular logic of their own. The show was
organized by Carnegie Mellon University Art Gallery.
</P>
<P>
"David Ireland: A Decade Documented 1978-1988" at UC Irvine (March 28 to April
29) will introduce a Northern California artist whose unusual architectural
environments are seldom seen in these parts with a group of drawings for
projects.
</P>
<P>
"Works by Helen and Newton Harrison," at the Laguna Art Museum (Jan. 20 to
March 12), will consist of drawings and hand-colored photographic works for
some of the couple's ecological projects.
</P>
<P>
A handful of other exhibits will explore pockets of art activity of more than
passing interest.
</P>
<P>
Newport Harbor's exhibit of work by avant-garde Moscow painter Erik Bulatov
will offer a glimpse of the way glasnost has affected the formerly
monolithically Socialist Realist output of Soviet art (July 28 to Oct. 1). The
museum has organized the exhibit in concert with the Renaissance Society of
Chicago and the Albert and Vera List Visual Arts Center at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
"Wayne Thiebaud: Works on Paper," due at UC Irvine (Oct. 8 to Nov. 4), is
billed as the first major retrospective of prints, drawings, watercolors and
paintings on paper by the Bay Area artist known best for his images of pies and
cakes and hilly landscapes. Thiebaud is very popular with viewers. (The Newport
Harbor show of the artist's paintings a couple of years ago was a smash hit.)
But I hope that this show (organized by the Richard L. Nelson Gallery and the
Fine Arts Collections at UC Davis) will provide a fresh outlook on his bright
and seductive body of work.
</P>
<P>
Another Bay Area artist is the focus of "Stephen De Staebler: The Figure," due
at the Laguna Art Museum (June 2 to Sept. 10). The exhibit (curated by Lynn
Gamwell for the museum and Saddleback College, where she was formerly director
of the art gallery) will survey the sculptor's life-size works in clay and
bronze. The monumental scale and fragmentary condition of these figures --
suggestive of archeological discoveries -- long ago gave De Staebler cult
status in Northern California. In a larger context, his work always struck me
as formulaic and redolent of little more than a sort of genteel, wistful
humanism.
</P>
<P>
But maybe this is the show that will change my mind. At the beginning of a new
year, even curmudgeonly critics hold out bouquets of hope.
